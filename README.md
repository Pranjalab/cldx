> **cldx is a layer on top of [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) that auto-approves safe tool calls and lets you supervise Claude from your phone via Telegram. Step away from your laptop. Come back to a finished feature.**

---

## Why this exists

### 1. Auto-approval — stop babysitting your AI

Claude Code is brilliant. It's also chatty: every `Bash`, every `Write`, every `Edit` pops a "Do you want to proceed?" menu. If you're a developer who writes a precise prompt and just wants the **tested, summarised result**, those approval clicks add up to dozens of context-switches per task.

cldx classifies every approval by **tool category** and **risk level**, then auto-approves the safe ones based on a policy *you* control. `Read`, `Grep`, and `Glob` get a green pass. `Write` and `Edit` go through a configurable 2-second countdown (so you can still cancel). `rm -rf`, `dd`, `sudo`, and writes under `/etc` or `~/.ssh` always escalate to a human — no policy can override that.

You stop clicking. Claude keeps moving. You see the final result.

### 2. Telegram bridge — step away from the laptop

Even with auto-approval, *some* things need a human call. The destructive ones. The genuinely ambiguous ones. That used to mean staying glued to your terminal.

cldx forwards those approvals to **Telegram** — the cheapest, most universal messaging bridge that runs on every phone. Go to the gym. Take a walk. Get coffee. When Claude hits a real decision point, your phone buzzes with a formatted card showing the tool, the args, the risk level, and a `y / n / 1 / 2 / 3 / free-text` reply protocol. You answer; Claude continues.

You get the agentic-coding life back. The model works while you live.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pranjalab/cldx.git
cd cldx
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. Picks a compatible Python (≥ 3.11; tries 3.13 → 3.12 → 3.11 in that order).
2. `pip install --user .` so the `cldx` command lands in your user-scripts dir.
3. Creates `~/.cldx/{config,sessions,logs}/` with bundled defaults (existing files are left untouched).
4. Tells you the exact `export PATH=...` line to add to `~/.zshrc` if `cldx` isn't on PATH yet.
5. Detects stale binaries from a different Python version and offers the one-line `ln -sf` to fix it.

**Override the state location** with `export CLDX_HOME=/some/path`. **Uninstall** with `./install.sh --uninstall` (leaves `~/.cldx/` in place so a re-install keeps your configs), or run `./uninstall.sh` for the dedicated uninstaller (see [Uninstall](#uninstall) below).

### Uninstall

A dedicated `./uninstall.sh` script removes the `cldx` package and — at your option — wipes the local state directory at `~/.cldx/`.

```bash
./uninstall.sh           # remove the package, ask before deleting ~/.cldx
./uninstall.sh --purge   # remove the package AND wipe ~/.cldx (no prompt)
./uninstall.sh --keep    # remove the package, keep ~/.cldx untouched
```

The script:

1. Picks a compatible Python (≥ 3.11; tries 3.13 → 3.12 → 3.11 → `python3`).
2. Runs `pip uninstall cldx` against that Python.
3. Optionally removes `~/.cldx/{config,sessions,logs}/` (override location via `CLDX_HOME`).

`./uninstall.sh` is safe to re-run — if `cldx` is already absent or `~/.cldx/` doesn't exist, the relevant step is skipped with a notice. Re-install any time with `./install.sh`.

### Optional setup wizard

```bash
cldx setup          # interactive — picks LLM backend + Telegram in sequence
cldx setup telegram # just the Telegram bridge
cldx setup llm      # just the LLM picker
cldx config         # show current secrets (masked)
```

The Telegram wizard walks you through `@BotFather`, auto-discovers your `chat_id`, sends a greeting message, and prints the slash-commands list to your phone.

### Pluggable LLM backends

cldx uses an LLM to **summarise** Claude's output before sending to Telegram (so you get one paragraph instead of 200 lines of tool output). Backends ship pluggable:

| Backend | Cost | Setup command |
|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** (direct API key) | ~$0.0001 / summary (Haiku) | `cldx setup anthropic` |
| **AWS Bedrock** (bearer token) | Your AWS rate | `cldx setup bedrock` |
| **Google Gemini** (free tier OK) | Free up to a quota | `cldx setup gemini` |
| **Disabled** (raw pane to Telegram) | $0 | `cldx setup` → option 4 |

When disabled, the raw structural `⏺...✻` slice of Claude's pane goes to Telegram (sanitised: no box-drawing chars, no banner art, no UI chrome).

---

## Run

```bash
cldx                  # interactive picker — pick a pane or start a new one
cldx --auto-detect    # auto-attach to the only running Claude pane
cldx --list-panes     # show all tmux panes and what's in them
```

## Features (v1.0.4)

### Auto-approval
- **Per-tool classification** — `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` are `safe`; `Write`/`Edit` are `elevated`; `Bash` gets risk refined from the command (`rm -rf` → `destructive`, `pip install` → `elevated`); writes under `/etc` or `~/.ssh` always escalate.
- **Per-profile defaults** — `auto-approve`, `yolo`, `restricted`, `default`, `paranoid`. Pick yours in `policy.yml` or switch live with `/profile <name>`.
- **Configurable wait bar** — auto-fires after N seconds; type anything during the countdown to override.
- **Yolo learning** — in `yolo` profile, your y/n choices get remembered per pattern (never for destructive ops).
- **Built-in safety floor** — `rm -rf`, `dd`, `mkfs`, `chmod -R`, `sudo`, `git push --force` etc. bypass auto-approve regardless of profile.

### Telegram bridge
- **Structured cards** — separate templates for approval / completion / escalation / greeting / error, all phone-screen-friendly.
- **Two-way control** — reply `y` / `n` / `1` / `2` / free-form text from anywhere in the world.
- **Slash commands** on Telegram: `/help`, `/status`, `/panes`, `/snapshot`, `/stop`, `/pause`, `/resume`, `/profile`, `/yes`, `/no`, `/cancel`. These never leak into Claude.
- **Runtime toggle** — `/telegram on` / `/telegram off` in the cldx terminal to silence forwarding without restarting.
- **Session-limit detector** — when Claude's 5-hour rolling Pro window hits, cldx parses the reset time, updates the header, and pings you on Telegram when the window reopens.

### UX
- **Bordered input box** styled like Claude Code's own (Tab to accept Claude's suggestion).
- **Dynamic header** shows what's connected: `Claude + TMUX`, `Claude + TMUX + Telegram`, `... (Resets at 7:50 pm)`.
- **Three-tier decision panels** — yellow (auto-approve pending), red (needs your call), green (task complete).
- **Mirror panel** preserves Claude's own ANSI styling, syntax colours, dim placeholders.
- **Structural ⏺...✻ extraction** — completion panels show exactly Claude's response, dropping your echo'd question and the duration line.

### Observability
- **Per-session interaction log** at `~/.cldx/logs/YYYY-MM-DD/HH-MM-SS_<profile>_<pane>.log` — every terminal input, every Telegram in/out, every cldx decision, every Claude output. Plain text. `tail -f` friendly.
- **JSONL event log** at `~/.cldx/sessions/<profile>/<timestamp>.jsonl` — machine-replayable.
- **Multi-session picker** — arrow keys, `d` to delete, resume from any prior session by date.

## Release 1.1.0

Minor version bump — the classifier and the live mirror were rebuilt around a structural anchor (the last `⏺` bullet), replacing the line-count tail heuristics that kept missing edge cases.

- 🛠 **Structural classifier.** State detection (approval / running / complete / idle) is now anchored on the last `⏺` bullet — the slice from there to the bottom of the pane is the scope, no line-count tail. Long file previews, multi-paragraph summaries, wrapped diff lines, and TodoWrite panels can be arbitrarily large without missing the menu or the `✻ <verb> for <time>` end marker. Same anchor drives `extract_final_message` and `_pane_has_tool_calls`.
- 🛠 **Mirror anchors on last `⏺`.** The live "claude pane" panel now shows from the last `⏺` to the bottom of the pane, growing past `--mirror-lines` (now a minimum) when needed. New `--mirror-max-lines` hard cap (default 200) keeps the mirror from blowing up on truly enormous responses. Capture window bumped 200 → 1000 lines so a long session doesn't drop the start of the current turn.
- 🛠 **Multi-line tool-call detection.** Added `pane_has_tool_call(text)` — recognises `⏺ ToolName(...` opening even when the closing `)` lives on a later pane line (Bash heredocs, multi-line `Write` args). Without this, real tasks with heredocs were demoted to "chat reply" cards and skipped the Telegram task-complete summary.
- 🛠 **`_extract_command` scans bottom-up.** With a wider window, scrollback from prior turns can contain older tool calls; the live one is the most recent in pane order. Bottom-up scan keeps tool-call attribution attached to the active approval.
- 📚 **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — rewritten with an explicit issue→PR workflow and a dedicated *"Contributing as an LLM agent"* section laying out hard rules for autonomous coding agents.
- 📚 **`CLAUDE.md`** — new project-context file for LLM agents working in this repo. Covers architecture, the structural-classifier invariant, conventions, and common gotchas.
- ✅ 540 passing tests (+16 since 1.0.6).

---

## Release 1.0.6

Follow-up to 1.0.5 — fixes one remaining approval-classification miss.

- 🐛 **Fix — diff-preview approvals.** Claude Code's `Edit(...)` renderer wraps every long diff line into multiple captured pane rows (each continuation prefixed with `+`); a 30-line README change can balloon to 100+ captured lines, pushing the `❯ 1. Yes` menu past the 80-line wide-tail window we set in 1.0.5. Wide-tail bumped to 200 (full capture). The completion window stays narrow (10 lines) so stale `✻ … for Ns` lines in scrollback can't false-fire.
- 🐛 **Fix — wrong tool-call attribution.** `_extract_command` now scans bottom-up, so the *most recent* `⏺ Tool(…)` wins when the wide window picks up scrollback from prior turns. Previously top-down — fine when the window was 20 lines, broken once it grew.
- ✅ 524 passing tests (+2 new regression tests).

---

## Release 1.0.5

Stability and developer-experience release on top of 1.0.4. Highlights:

- 🐛 **Fix — tmux startup crash.** `cldx` no longer raises an uncaught `SessionPickerError` when there's no tmux server or no sessions. It falls back to a clean "start new tmux + claude" option; a missing tmux binary now prints a readable error instead of a Python traceback.
- 🐛 **Fix — multi-line approvals.** The classifier widened its active-prompt window (20 → 80 lines) so a long `Write(...)` file preview plus the Claude TodoWrite panel can't push the `❯ 1. Yes` menu out of scope. Completion detection moved to a narrower 10-line window so a stale `✻ … for Ns` in scrollback can't masquerade as a fresh completion.
- 🐛 **Fix — completion result clutter.** New `extract_final_message` extractor; the green "✓ Task complete" panel and the Telegram message now show only Claude's closing summary (the final `⏺` block) instead of the full chain of intermediate `⏺ Bash(…)` / `⏺ Write(…)` tool calls.
- 📦 **`./uninstall.sh`** — dedicated uninstaller. Removes the package and (interactively or via `--purge` / `--keep`) wipes `~/.cldx`.
- 🤖 **CI matrix.** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs `pytest` on Ubuntu + macOS × Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` publishes to PyPI via OIDC trusted publishing on each GitHub release.
- 📝 **Community hygiene.** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, issue + PR templates.
- ✅ 522 passing tests (+14 since 1.0.4).

---

## Release 1.0.4

The first stable release. Everything since the original prototype has gone through real-world use:

- ✅ All 7 build phases shipped (session storage, three-tier policy + wait bar, startup picker, yolo learning, agent persona + LLM, Telegram bridge).
- ✅ Multi-backend LLM (Anthropic / Bedrock / Gemini / disabled).
- ✅ Tool-call classification with risk refinement.
- ✅ Structural `⏺...✻` result extractor.
- ✅ Multi-word display-name parsing (`Web Search`, `Web Fetch`, `Multi Edit`…).
- ✅ Auto-detect Claude's session limit + reset notifier.
- ✅ 508 passing tests covering classifier, policy, Telegram, sanitiser, conversation extractor, tool registry.
- ✅ Documented: install, GUIDELINE, FEATURES roadmap, code of conduct.

```

- **Monitor** — polls `tmux capture-pane` once a second, computes a stable hash of the pane tail, fires `on_change` / `on_stable` callbacks.
- **Classify** — every snapshot runs through `PromptClassifier` which uses both pattern matching AND structural rules (a Claude turn = `⏺ ... ✻`).
- **Decide** — `PolicyEngine` reads `policy.yml`, applies the active profile, runs destructive-pattern checks, returns `AUTO_YES / AUTO_NO / WAIT_LOCAL / ESCALATE_TELEGRAM`.
- **Act** — for auto-decisions, `TmuxController.send_keys` types the response into the pane. For escalations, `TelegramBridge` sends a card and waits for your reply.

No daemons. No background services. One process per Claude pane, cleanly killable with Ctrl-D.

## Inspiration

cldx is inspired by the pattern of **remote-controlling a long-running agent**. If you've used OpenInterpreter or thought "I wish I could just text my Claude session from the bus", that's the same itch.

The two design choices that define cldx:

- **Auto-approval is the default**, not a power-user toggle. The whole point is *not clicking*.
- **Telegram is the chosen medium**, not because it's the best, but because it's the cheapest, most universal, and easiest to integrate. Free on every phone. No proprietary clients. No subscription. Your bot, your chat, your control.

---

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) for the incredible agentic tool capabilities.
- **tmux** for enabling reliable terminal multiplexing and session control.
- **Telegram** for providing a fast, universal, and accessible messaging platform.
